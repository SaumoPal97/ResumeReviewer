# ResumeReviewer
ResumeReviewer will prepare students for resume based interview rounds during Placements by highlighting critical topics and suggesting relevant questions based on past interviews. 

The major parts of ResumeReviewer are - 
1. Resume parser
2. Resume correction
3. Context modifications 
4. Impact understanding
5. Key highlights
6. Interview question suggestion
7. Interface design

Most of the above goals are subjective to change according to feasibility and general feedback from other developers. Given KWOC will run for 4 weeks, I am hoping to get the first, second, fifth and sixth points to be covered, even if they might not be production level. So the timeline would approximately look like - 
- [ ] Resume parser - 7th to 13th December 
- [ ] Resume correction - 14th to 20th December 
- [ ] Key highlights - 21st to 27th December
- [ ] Interview question suggestion - 28th to 2nd Jan

Tech stack will be predominantly Python based, and powered by open source libraries (unless using a paid API is the only option). Please keep checking the README for further updates, and join the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/resumereviewerkwoc/shared_invite/enQtODUxNTQ2NDYyODAwLTRjZmNkZWM4NGVmNTdlMmRmMzBkMWY3NmUzNDk3OTYyNzdkNDY3NTg0OWU0MzkxYTc5ZGU4NWM1NmUxYmQ3YjE) for further discussion regarding key development decisions.
